#All-Inclusive Guide to Bay Area Tech meetups

Do you want to get better at programming? :computer: Maybe you want to network, improve job prospects, listen to cool talks, and meet amazing people. WELL THEN…you should go to some tech meetups all over the Bay Area! But there's so many, you protest! :flushed:

As a devangelist intern last summer in the heart of *SoMa* :yum: (South of Market, San Francisco), I attended up to four meetups per week! I loved going for the lively discussions with engineers, evangelists, designers, students, and a plethora of people from not just San Francisco or the Bay Area, but from all over the world. I relished office visits, swag, raffles, talks, workshops, and just the atmosphere in general. Though I was often one of the only, if not the only, intern, I was treated exactly like *any other meetup attendee*. There was often an aura of **creativity**, **innovation**, **startup ideas**, and it was amazing how I could learn something from everyone I met, and also teach them some things, too (I hope.) :wink: I have been to most of the meetups listed here, and heard of all of these—you can probably tell the ones I enjoy and recommend based on emoji usage! 

## Where to look for meetups :collision:

Yes, [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com) is A+. They have so many meetups (not just tech-related), and meetups in locations all over the world! Many of the meetups here are monthly, weekly, or meet routinely. Similarly, I also recommend [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com) for more special meetups (less routine), as well as hackathons and conferences. [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) also has a few, which I often find in tech-related groups (Hackathon Hackers, Ladies Storm Hackathons, but more often, in their subgroups, often targeted at location or platform ie iOS, web, IoT, etc.)


##:fire:Top meetups (IMO)

## Meetups by location

### SoMa meetups

<br>
### Palo Alto meetups

<br>
##Networking
Whatever can you talk about with people at meetups? If it’s an iOS meetup, I’m guessing you’re both interested in iOS. If it’s at, say, GitHub, there are always cool stickers and the Octocat statue. Get out of your comfort zone! :scream:
<br>
### Get connections

Connections are very useful -- you should meet as many people as you can in your industry. They can help you land interviews and improve the company's opinion of you (and vice versa).

### Keep in touch
Add people on LinkedIn, Twitter. Don’t be afraid to ask for business cards or emails or anything. Chances are, you’ll see these people at future meetups, or at other tech meetups around SF. I’m surprised at how tight-knit some of the meetups, or developer community/ies in general are!

##Speaking

+ Web: [React Native](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScKi1v_49wcobNZjfC5ELZV0dZvORZ4ZEGsf4iiDTAtCS5gzw/viewform?c=0&w=1),

+ Mobile: [Android, iOS, and more](https://goo.gl/forms/wZMyz6xNsg6ZA5173)
<br>

##Conclusion

There are so many meetups to choose from, both in and out of the Bay Area. Go for the people, go for the community, and go to learn from not just speakers, but attendees. Yes, you can network, but there's so much knowledge to gain and also impart on others. 

*TODO*: Been to any meetups? Heard of any good ones? Well, then fork this repo, submit some pull requests, and contribute! Add thoughts on meetups you've attended in the Bay Area, alphabetize, and create different categories.
